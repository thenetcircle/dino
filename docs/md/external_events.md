* target.objectType: "room", "channel" or "global"
* object.id: ID of the user
* object.displayName: name fo the user

If `target.objectType` is `global` then no `target.id` or `target.displayName` will be included.

## User sends a message to a room/user

Whenever a user sends a message an event will be published to the configured MQ, so another system can analyze activity
level of users. Example activity: 

```json
{
    "actor": {
        "id": "<user ID>",
        "displayName": "<base64 encoded username>"
    },
    "object": {
        "id": "<uuid of the message that was sent>"
    },
    "verb": "send",
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>"
}
```

## One session has ended

Multiple session can exist for a single user. A disconnect event is only sent when the last session has been closed, but a "session closed" event is sent for each session that is closed. Example activity:

```json
{
    "actor": {
        "id": "<user ID>",
        "displayName": "<base64 encoded username>",
        "content": "<session UUID>"
    },
    "verb": "ended",
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>"
}
```

## User successfully logged in

Example of activity when a user successfully logs in:

```json
{
	"id": "2190e4b9-6b80-4d86-992f-e107ae19be96",
	"title": "dino.wio.login",

		}],
		"displayName": "Um9iYnk=",

}
```

## A user was reported for a message he/she sent

A message may be reported in the front-end, and a report will be published to the MQ. The event looks like this:

```json
{
    "actor": {
        "id": "<user ID that reported the message>",
        "displayName": "<the user name who reported the message>"
    },
    "object": {
        "id": "<uuid of message>",
        "content": "<the actual message to report, base64>",
        "summary": "<optional reason text, base64>"
    },
    "target": {
        "id": "<user ID to report>",
        "displayName": "<the user name of the reported user>"
    },
    "verb": "report",
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>"
}
```

## User disconnected

Example of activity when a user disconnects:

```json
{
    "actor": {
        "id": "<user ID>",
        "displayName": "<base64 encoded username>"
    },
    "verb": "disconnect",
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>"
}
```

## User becomes invisible

When a user changes the status to become invisible the following event is published to the external queue:

```json
{
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "actor": {
        "id": "635328",
        "displayName": "amtia2prYmJrag=="
    },
    "verb": "invisible",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>"
}
```

## User becomes visible after being in visible

When a user changes his status to become visible again after being invisible the following event is sent to the external queue:

```json
{   
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "actor": {
        "id": "635328",
        "displayName": "amtia2prYmJrag=="
    },  
    "verb": "online",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>"
}   
```
