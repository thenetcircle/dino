## Message deleted

When an admin/mod/etc. deletes a message from a room, everyone on that room will receive an event with the name 
`gn_message_deleted` so they can remove it locally as well.

```json
{
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>",
    "object": {
        "id": "<UUID of the message that was deleted>"
    },
    "target": {
        "id": "<UUID of the room the message was deleted in>"
    },
    "verb": "delete",
    "actor": {
        "id": "<ID of the user who deleted the message>",
        "displayName": "<name of the user, base64>"
    }
}
```

## Message received

When user A receives a private message, or a message from a room that user A is in, the event `message` will be sent
to user A with the following content:

```json
{
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>",
    "actor": {
        "id": "<UUID of the sender>",
        "displayName": "<name of the sender>"
    },
    "verb": "send",
    "target": {
        "id": "<UUID of the room, or this user's UUID if private msg>",
        "displayName": "<name of the room, or target user name if private msg>",
        "objectType": "<room/private>"
    },
    "object": {
        "content": "<the message body>",
        "displayName": "<the name of the channel, or empty if private msg>",
        "url": "<UUID of the channel for this room, or empty if private msg>"
    }
}
```

## Message has been read

If user A sends a message to user B and user B invokes the `read` api to indicate the message has been read, user A
will receive a `gn_message_read` event with the following content:

```json
{
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>",
    "actor": {
        "id": "<user id of the one sending the read receipt>"
    },
    "verb": "read",
    "target": {
        "id": "<uuid of the room the messages are all in>" 
    },   
    "object": {
        "attachments": [
            {"id": "<message1 uuid>"},
            {"id": "<message2 uuid>"},
            {"id": "<message3 uuid>"}
        ]    
    }    
}
```

## Message has been delivered

If user A sends a message to user B and user B invokes the `received` api to indicate the message has been received,
user A will receive a `gn_message_received` event with the following content:

```json
{   
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>",
    "actor": {
        "id": "<user id of the one sending the read receipt>"
    },
    "verb": "received",
    "target": {
        "id": "<uuid of the room the messages are all in>" 
    },   
    "object": {
        "attachments": [
            {"id": "<message1 uuid>"},
            {"id": "<message2 uuid>"},
            {"id": "<message3 uuid>"}
        ]    
    }    
}   
```

## User info updated

When a user updates his/her user information (e.g. avatar, is streaming, age etc.), the event `gn_user_info_updated`
will be sent to either all rooms that the user is in, or a specific room that user chose to send to. The event looks 
like this:

```json
{
    "actor": {
        "id": "997110",
        "displayName": "YmF0bWFu"
    },
    "object": {
        "attachments": [{
            "content": "MA==",
            "objectType": "streaming"
        },{
            "content": "MzU=",
            "objectType": "age"
        }],
        "objectType": "userInfo"
    },
    "verb": "update",
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>"
}
```

The `content` on each attachment is always base64 encoded. The `objectType` tells which field has been updated. Possible
values depends on implementation, but is usually same as what's returned for user info when joining a room (`gn_join`).

## Admin presence requested

When someone requests the presence of an admin in a room all users in the Admin room for that channel will receive an
event called `gn_admin_requested` containing the following:

```json
{
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>",
    "actor": {
        "id": "<UUID of user requesting>",
        "displayName": "<name of the user requesting>",,
        "attachments": [
            {
                "content": "NDA=",
                "objectType": "age"
            },
            {
                "content": "aHR0cDovL3NvbWUtdXJsLnRsZC9mb28uanBn",
                "objectType": "avatar"
            }
        ]
    },
    "verb": "help",
    "object": {
        "content": "<base64 encoded message>"
    },
    "generator": {
        "id": "<UUID of the room the help was requested for>",
        "displayName": "<name of the room>"
    },
    "target": {
        "id": "<UUID of the admin room>",
        "displayName": "<base64 of the admin room name>"
    }
}
```

## A room was removed

When a room is removed by an admin/owner an event called `gn_room_removed` will be sent to everyone on the server (to
keep the room list in sync on client side):

```json
{
    "actor": {
        "id": "<user ID who removed the room>",
        "displayName": "<name of the user who removed the room, in base64>"
    },
    "target": {
        "id": "<room uuid>",
        "displayName": "<room name in base64>",
        "objectType": "room"
    },
    "object": {
        "content": "<an optional reason, in base64>"
    },
    "id": "c42ebf01-3d50-4f27-a345-4ed213be045d",
    "published": "2016-10-07T10:45:34Z",
    "verb": "removed"
}
```

## A room was renamed

When a room is renamed by an admin/owner an event called `gn_room_renamed` will be sent to everyone on the server (to
keep the room list in sync on client side):

```json
{
    "actor": {
        "id": "<user ID who renamed the room>",
        "displayName": "<name of the user who renamed the room, in base64>"
    },
    "target": {
        "id": "<room uuid>",
        "displayName": "<NEW room name in base64>",
        "objectType": "room"
    },
    "id": "c42ebf01-3d50-4f27-a345-4ed213be045d",
    "published": "2016-10-07T10:45:34Z",
    "verb": "renamed"
}
```

## Invitation received

When user B invites user A to join room X, the event `gn_invitation` will be sent to user A with the following content:

```json
{
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>",
    "actor": {
        "id": "<UUID of user B>",
        "displayName": "<name of user B>",,
        "attachments": [
            {
                "content": "NDA=",
                "objectType": "age"
            },
            {
                "content": "aHR0cDovL3NvbWUtdXJsLnRsZC9mb28uanBn",
                "objectType": "avatar"
            }
        ]
    },
    "verb": "invite",
    "object": {
        "url": "<UUID of the channel for room X>",
        "displayName": "<name of the channel for room X>"
    },
    "target": {
        "id": "<UUID of the room>",
        "displayName": "<name of the room>"
    }
}
```

## Another user joins the room 

If user A is in room X, and another user B joins room X, the server will send an event called `gn_user_joined` to user A
with the following content:

```json
{
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>",
    "actor": {
        "id": "<user B's UUID>",
        "displayName": "<name of user B>",
        "content": "globalmod,moderator"
        "image": {
            "url": "<user B's image url>"
        },
        "attachments": [
            {
                "content": "NDA=",
                "objectType": "age"
            },
            {
                "content": "aHR0cDovL3NvbWUtdXJsLnRsZC9mb28uanBn",
                "objectType": "avatar"
            }
        ]
    },
    "target": {
        "id": "<uuid of the room>",
        "displayName": "<name of the room>"
    },
    "verb": "join"
}
```

The `actor.content` describes the roles this user has in this room, plus any global roles. Examples:

* `globalmod,moderator`
* `moderator`
* `superuser`

If no specific roles, the value will be blank.

## Another user leaves room

When user A is in room X, and another user B leaves room X, the sever will send an event called `gn_user_left` to user A
with the following content:

```json
{
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>",
    "actor": {
        "id": "<user B's UUID>",
        "displayName": "<name of user B>",
    },
    "target": {
        "id": "<uuid of the room>",
        "displayName": "<name of the room>"
    },
    "verb": "leave"
}
```

## Another user connects

When a user connects (or stops being invisible), the `gn_user_connected` event will be sent.

```json
{
    "actor": {
        "id": "<user B's UUID>",
        "displayName": "<name of user B>",
        "attachments": [
            {
                "content": "NDA=",
                "objectType": "age"
            },
            {
                "content": "aHR0cDovL3NvbWUtdXJsLnRsZC9mb28uanBn",
                "objectType": "avatar"
            }
        ]
    },
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>",
    "verb": "connect"
}
```

## Another user disconnects

If user A is in any room that user B is in, and user B disconnects from the chat server, an event called
`gn_user_disconnected` will be sent to user A with the following content:

```json
{
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>",
    "actor": {
        "id": "<user B's UUID>",
        "displayName": "<name of user B>",
    },
    "verb": "disconnect"
}
```

## You were banned

If you are banned, either in a room, a channel or globally, you will receive the following event named `gn_banned`:

```json
{
    "actor": {
        "id": "<ID of the one who banned you>",
        "displayName": "<username of the one who banned you, in base64>"
    },
    "object": {
        "id": "<your user ID>",
        "displayName": "<your username in base64>",
        "summary": "30s",
        "updated": "2017-02-15T09:11:52Z",
        "content": "<the reason for the ban>"
    },
    "target": {
        "id": "<room/channel uuid>",
        "displayName": "<room/channel name, in base64>",
        "objectType": "<room/channel/global>"
    },
    "verb": "ban",
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>"
}
```

* target.id and target.displayName will not be present if target.objectType is "global",
* object.summary is the duration of the ban, e.g. 30s, 2h, 7d etc.,
* object.updated is the timestamp when the ban will expire, in UTC,
* object.content is the reason for the ban, but if no reason is given by the banned, this field will not be present.

## A new room is created

When a new room is created in a channel that user A is in, an event called `gn_room_created` will be sent to user A with
the following content:

```json
{
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>",
    "actor": {
        "id": "<UUID of user who created the room>",
        "displayName": "<name of the user who created the room>",,
        "attachments": [
            {
                "content": "NDA=",
                "objectType": "age"
            },
            {
                "content": "aHR0cDovL3NvbWUtdXJsLnRsZC9mb28uanBn",
                "objectType": "avatar"
            }
        ]
    },
    "object": {
        "url": "<UUID of the channel for this room>"
    },
    "target": {
        "id": "<UUID of the new room>",
        "displayName": "<name of the new room>",
        "objectType": "temporary"
    },
    "verb": "create"
}
```
    
The `target.objectType` will always be `temporary` since all rooms created using the API are user created rooms, meaning
they will be automatically removed when the owner leaves.

## A user is kicked from a room

When a user is kicked from a room, an event will be sent to all users in that room (except the kicked user), called 
`gn_user_kicked`, with the following content:

```json
{
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>",
    "actor": {
        "id": "<UUID of the kicker>",
        "displayName": "<name of the kicker>",
        "attachments": [
            {
                "content": "NDA=",
                "objectType": "age"
            },
            {
                "content": "aHR0cDovL3NvbWUtdXJsLnRsZC9mb28uanBn",
                "objectType": "avatar"
            }
        ]
    },
    "object": {
        "id": "<UUID of the kicked user>",
        "displayName": "<name of the kicked user>",
        "content": "<optional reason field>",
        "attachments": [
            {
                "content": "NDA=",
                "objectType": "age"
            },
            {
                "content": "aHR0cDovL3NvbWUtdXJsLnRsZC9mb28uanBn",
                "objectType": "avatar"
            }
        ]
    },
    "target": {
        "id": "<UUID of the room the user was kicked from>",
        "displayName": "<name of the room the user was kicked from>"
    },
    "verb": "kick"
}
```

## Broadcast received

When a message is broadcasted to every user on the server, a `gn_broadcast` event is received:

```json
{
    "actor": {
        "displayName": "<admin in base64>",
        "id": "0" 
    },  
    "content": "<base64>",
    "verb": "broadcast",
    "id": "<server-generated UUID>",
    "published": "<server-generated timestamp, RFC3339 format>",
    "provider": {
        "id": "popp"
    }
}
```

## A user is banned

TODO: currently the user will be banned, but the "kicked" event will be broadcasted to relevant users. There's currently
no "banned" event for this.
